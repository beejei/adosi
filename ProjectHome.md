**Adosi** is a media player designed to demonstrate the many capabilities of the Bass streaming audio api. Adosi takes advantage of the new .NET 3.0 WPF interfaces to present a nice clean interface with a bundle of animations and interactions.

Adosi loads the mainstream playlist (.pls) format automatically. Adosi will play all the audio types that are supported in the Bass Audio api. Right now, you can install the Adosi Audio Visual Studio Starter Kit to develop your own features and modifications.

### [Un4seen Bass](http://un4seen.com/bass.html) ###
BASS is an audio library for use in Windows and Mac OSX software. Its purpose is to provide developers with powerful and efficient sample, stream (MP3, MP2, MP1, OGG, WAV, AIFF, custom generated, and more via add-ons), MOD music (XM, IT, S3M, MOD, MTM, UMX), MO3 music (MP3/OGG compressed MODs), and recording functions. All in a tiny DLL, under 100KB**in size.**

On Windows, BASS requires DirectX 3 or above for output, and takes advantage of DirectSound and DirectSound3D hardware accelerated drivers, when available. On OSX, BASS uses CoreAudio for output, and OSX 10.3 or above is recommended. Both PowerPC and Intel Macs are supported.

C/C++, Delphi, Visual Basic and MASM APIs are provided, with several examples to get you started. .Net and other APIs are also available.
